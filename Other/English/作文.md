# Working from Home
```
I. Advantages of working from home.
(1) Provide more time for productive work
Home office allows people to eliminate or reduce commuting time, will have more time and energy to devote to work. If the home office is properly arranged, it can also reduce the usual distractions in the office, such as loud phone calls from colleagues, ringing phones, unknown odors, and unnecessarily strict policies. By reducing chores and making workers less distracted, home office workers will be able to focus more on what they are doing and get their work done quickly.
(2) Better work-life balance
Research shows that jobs that have a good work-life balance increase employee satisfaction with their jobs. It goes without saying that when you feel better about your job, you will be more motivated to do your job, which is also better for your mental state and physical health.
(3) Save money
Since you don't have to leave home, you can save a lot of money. These include spending on commuting, clothing expenses, expensive take-out costs or going out to restaurants, etc.
(4) Higher employee retention
You heard it right, people who work from home are more likely to stay with the company rather than leave, and of course the company can give employees the right to work in the office, giving them more options and more freedom. In this way, working from home increases job and life satisfaction, making employee turnover rates lower, and employers save on the cost of hiring and training new employees when they don't leave the company as often.
Second, the disadvantages of working from home.
(1) Delay
One of the main reasons companies allow employees to work from home is to reduce the time they spend on transportation. However, when working from home, you may not schedule your time correctly because of the lack of company management, so that you may overestimate the time you actually have by procrastinating when working from home. So plan your day, do the task at hand, and avoid procrastination.
(2) Burnout
Sometimes we do a lot of work, but when there is a tangle between work responsibilities and household chores with no boundaries, employees have the risk of being more exhausted. This is because you feel overwhelmed by things leading to stress, but still need to sit in front of the computer and work all day. In addition, you may also produce some burnout symptoms including headaches, irritability, increased errors and reduced efficiency.
(3) Collaboration is more difficult
Working from home can be difficult in terms of collaboration, but if you have the tools you need to communicate effectively with your team, this difficulty will be greatly reduced. A few other reasons why working from home makes collaboration more difficult include spotty Internet connections, time zone differences, and technical issues.
Teamwork function
(4) Loneliness
There are times when working side-by-side with colleagues makes work more interesting. One of the main factors contributing to employee engagement and satisfaction is maintaining friendships with colleagues. In fact, one study showed that loneliness affects employee performance and that maintaining positive social communication relationships can alleviate loneliness in the workplace.
There are many drawbacks, though in some industries they can be avoided, so the number of companies using work-at-home has been steadily increasing, especially in industries such as the Internet, digital marketing, and education.

一、居家办公的优势：
（1）为生产工作提供更多时间
居家办公使人可以消除或减少上下班时间，将有更多的时间和精力去投入到工作。如果居家办公安排得当，还可以减少办公室中通常会受到的干扰，例如同事大声打电话、电话响、不明的气味，以及不必要的严格政策。居家办公通过减少琐事来使工作者更少分心，将能够更专注于他们正在做的事情，并且快速完成工作。
（2）工作与生活得到更好地平衡
研究表明，能将工作时间与生活平衡好的工作会提高员工对工作的满意度。不言而喻，当你对工作感觉好一点时，你会更有动力去做你的工作，这也对你的精神状态与身体健康更好。
（3）省钱
由于不必离开家，可以节省许多费用。其中包括用于通勤的花费、服装开支、昂贵的外卖费用或下馆子的花费等。
（4）更高的员工保留率
你没有听错，居家办公的人更有可能留在公司而不是离职，当然公司也可以给予员工办公室工作的权利，让员工获得更多的选择，自由度更高。这样一来，居家上班就提高了工作和生活满意度，使得员工离职率降低，当员工不经常离开公司时，雇主也会节省雇佣和培训新员工的成本。
二、居家办公的缺点：
（1）拖延
公司允许员工在家工作的主要原因之一是减少了他们在交通上的时间。但是，在居家办公时，你可能不会正确地安排时间，因为缺乏公司的管理，这样一来，你在办公时可能会通过拖延来高估你实际拥有的时间。所以计划好你的每一天，做好手头的任务，避免拖延。
（2）倦怠
有时我们做了很多工作，但是当工作责任和家务劳动之间纠缠不清，没有边界时，员工有着更加筋疲力尽的风险。这是因为你觉得事情过于繁杂导致压力过大，却依然需要坐在电脑前工作一整天。除此之外，你还可能产生一些倦怠症状包括头痛、易怒、错误增加和效率降低。
（3）协作难度更大
居家办公在协作方面会很困难，但是如果你拥有与团队进行有效沟通所需的工具，这种困难将大大降低。居家办公使协作更加困难的其他几个原因包括网际网络连接不稳定、时区不同以及技术问题等。
团队协作功能
（4）孤独
有的时候，与同事并肩作战让工作更有趣。促进员工敬业度和满意度的主要因素之一是与同事保持友谊。事实上，一项研究表明，孤独会影响员工的表现，保持积极的社会交流关系可以缓解工作场所的孤独感。
虽然有很多缺点，不过在有些行业，是可以避免这些缺点的，因此使用居家办公的公司数量一直在稳步增加，特别是互联网、数字营销、教育等行业。
